### üíª About Me

My work spans from building user interfaces to integrating back-end systems, with a focus on creating reusable components and writing clean code. I am also skilled in DevOps practices, including CI/CD and Docker, as well as server and GitHub repository management.

I have a proven track record of migrating systems from manual spreadsheets to API-based databases (MySQL) and developing data-driven dashboards using Looker Studio to support business decisions. My expertise also includes implementing **IT Governance based on COBIT 2019** to ensure system security and compliance.

I believe that my blend of technical skills, comprehensive system understanding, and a keen eye for user experience allows me to be an adaptive, collaborative, and solution-oriented Software Engineer.
